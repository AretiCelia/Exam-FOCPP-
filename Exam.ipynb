    "I work best when I have a **good environment and work tool** and *minimal distractions*. I use a reliable editor like **VS Code** or **Jupyter Notebook** which helps me stay organized and focused and also makes my work easier. I prefer working with version control so I can experiment without thefear of breaking things. I like to break problems into small steps and test frequently as well as get help from my peers when i come accross problems.\n",
